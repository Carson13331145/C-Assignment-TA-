Please create a class Vector.(N-dimension)
The declaration of Vector is in 'Vector.h'
before programing, you should revise the knowledge about constructer and destructer.
note:
// constructer, print out "construct a vector called vector_name.\n"
Vector(string, int, int[]);
// copy constructer, print out "copy a vector called vector_name.\n"
Vector(const Vector &otherVec);
// destructer, print out "release memory from a vector called vector_name.\n"
~Vector();
// check two vector is whether the same or not
// if same name but the value is not, print like "same name, different value.\n"
// other conditions are the similar with the format above.
isEqual();
// set the name of the vector
void setName(string);
// display the vecter in the format "vecter_name(1, 2..N)\n"
void print();
